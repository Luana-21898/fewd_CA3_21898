<h2>Initial idea:</h2>
The initial idea of the project was to show my background compared to my experience in other fields (purchasing and logistics), skills developed and also a little of my personal interests.

<h2>The idea behind my design:</h2>
The colors in blue were chosen according to the background: the moon.
Synonymous of transformation and evolution, the moon is related to this personal transition: changing to the IT area.

<h2>Problems that occurred / solutions:</h2>
Some personal problems happened during the project's due date, limiting the use of better resources and also the delivery of a better profile.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
Although I had some problems, I will definitely continue working on this project due to the huge importance of having a personal profile to apply for a job.
